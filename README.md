# Hospital-Readmission-Analysis
This project is an end-to-end data analysis and business intelligence case study focused on identifying and understanding the factors contributing to hospital readmissions. The goal is to transform raw patient data into actionable insights that can help improve healthcare outcomes and operational efficiency.

# Project Objectives
- **Data Cleaning & Quality Assessment** : Thoroughly clean a raw hospital dataset, handling missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates.
- **Data Transformation** : Engineer new features by grouping complex ICD-9 diagnosis codes into more readable, high-level categories.
- **Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Calculation**: Develop core business metrics such as Readmission Rate and High-Risk Patient percentages using Tableau.  
- **Descriptive Analysis** : Perform exploratory analysis to uncover trends related to patient demographics, diagnosis types, and length of stay.
- **Data Visualization** : Prepare a clean dataset suitable for ** Tableau ** to create a comprehensive, interactive dashboard.

# Technologies Used
- **SQL** : The primary tool used for all data cleaning, transformation, and analysis. All queries are documented and organized for clarity.
- **Tableau** : The project is designed to produce a final, clean table that can be directly used for dashboarding and visualization.

# Key Project Stages
1. **Initial Data Audit** : A quality-check query to understand the state of the raw data, including counts of missing values and duplicates.
2. **Base Table Creation** : A new, clean base table is created by handling placeholders and standardizing data formats.
3. **Diagnosis Categorization** : ICD-9 codes are mapped to major medical categories (e.g., Circulatory System, Endocrine & Nutritional) using CASE statements.
4. **Final Analysis Table** : A final, comprehensive table is generated for all subsequent analysis and visualization, including all cleaned and transformed fields.

# Key Findings & KPIs
This repository showcases the following key metrics and insights derived from the dataset:
- **Overall Readmission Rate** :  The total percentage of patients readmitted.
- **Total Patients**: The total count of unique patients in the dataset.
- **High-Risk Patients**: A specific metric identifying the number and percentage of patients readmitted more than once.
- **Top Readmission Diagnoses**: Identification of the primary medical conditions driving readmissions.
- **Demographic Insights**: Analysis of readmission rates and patient counts across different age groups and genders.
